# Deprecated.

Discord.js v14 has been released and as usual. it is filled with retarded breaking changes for "the benefit of everyone". I suggest you stop using discord.js and just make your own library instead. I even suggest using eris instead of keeping up with the bullshit changes the 'developers' of discord.js does every second. Fuck discord.js and I sincerely hope they burn down crashing. Pull stack developer out.ss
